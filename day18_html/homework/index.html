            A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. 
            Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads,
            seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people,
            not cargo.[1][2] French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built 
            the first <u>steam-powered road vehicle</u> in 1769, while French-born 
            Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed 
            the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.
        </p>
        <b>
            The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was
            invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.

        <i>
            Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first
            cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American
            car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted
        </i>
        <p>
            in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe
            and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase
            until after World War II.[4] The car is considered 
            an essential part of the developed economy.
        </p>

            Cars have controls for driving, parking, 
            passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, 
            additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, 
            making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras,
            air conditioning, <u>navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.
            Most <b>cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal
            combustion engine,</b> fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels.
            Electric cars, which were invented</u> early in the history of the car,
            became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost
            less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025.[5][6] The transition 
            from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most
            climate change mitigation scenarios,[7] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable
            solutions for climate change.[8]
